# Completion functions called by other functions

### _userland()
Check if we're running on the given userland

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | userland to check for |


### _sysvdirs()
This function sets correct SysV init directories


### _have()
This function checks whether we have a given program on the system.


### have()
**@deprecated** should no longer be used; generally not needed with dynamically loaded completions, and `_have` is suitable for runtime use.  
Backwards compatibility for compat completions that use `have()`.


### _rl_enabled()
This function checks whether a given readline variable is 'on'.


### quote()
This function shell-quotes the argument


### quote_readline()
See `_quote_readline_by_ref()`


### dequote()
This function shell-dequotes the argument


### _upvar()
Assign variable one scope above the caller

#### Usage
```
local "$1" && _upvar $1 "value(s)"
```

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | Variable name to assign value to |
| $* | Value(s) to assign.  If multiple values, an array is assigned, otherwise a single value is assigned. |

#### Note
For assigning multiple variables, use `_upvars`.  
Do **NOT** use multiple `_upvar` calls, since one `_upvar` call might reassign a variable to be used by another `_upvar` call.

#### See
[http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Passing_variables_by_reference](http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Passing_variables_by_reference)


### _upvars()
Assign variables one scope above the caller

#### Usage
```
local varname [varname ...] && _upvars [-v varname value] | [-aN varname [value ...]] ...
```

#### Available OPTIONS
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| -aN | Assign next N values to varname as array |
| -v | Assign single value to varname |

#### Return
`1` if error occurs

#### See
[http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Passing_variables_by_reference](http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Passing_variables_by_reference)


### __reassemble_comp_words_by_ref()
Reassemble command line words, excluding specified characters from the list of word completion separators (`COMP_WORDBREAKS`).

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | chars - Characters out of `$COMP_WORDBREAKS` which should **NOT** be considered word breaks. <br/>This is useful for things like `scp` where we want to return `host:path` and not only `path`, so we would pass the colon (`:`) as `$1` here.
| $2 | words - Name of variable to return words to |
| $3 | cword - Name of variable to return cword to |


### __get_cword_at_cursor_by_ref()

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | exclude  Characters out of `$COMP_WORDBREAKS` which should **NOT** be considered word breaks. <br/>This is useful for things like `scp` where we want to return `host:path` and not only `path|, so we would pass the colon (`:`) as `$1` in this case.
| $2 | words - Name of variable to return words to |
| $3 | cword - Name of variable to return cword to |
| $4 | cur - Name of variable to return current word to complete to |

#### See
`__reassemble_comp_words_by_ref()`


### _get_comp_words_by_ref()
Get the word to complete and optional previous words.  
This is nicer than `${COMP_WORDS[$COMP_CWORD]}`, since it handles cases where the user is completing in the middle of a word.  
For example, if the line is following with cursor as shown:
```
ls foobar
     ^
```
Also one is able to cross over possible wordbreak characters.

#### Usage
```
_get_comp_words_by_ref [OPTIONS] [VARNAMES]
```

#### Available VARNAMES
| VARNAME | description |
| --- | --- |
| cur | Return cur via `$cur` |
| prev | Return prev via `$prev` |
| words | Return words via `$words` |
| cword | Return cword via `$cword` |

#### Available OPTIONS
| OPTION | description |
| --- | --- |
| -n EXCLUDE | Characters out of `$COMP_WORDBREAKS` which should **NOT** be considered word breaks. <br/>This is useful for things like `scp` where we want to return `host:path` and not only `path`, so we would pass the colon (`:`) as `-n` option in this case.
| -c VARNAME | Return cur via $VARNAME |
| -p VARNAME | Return prev via $VARNAME |
| -w VARNAME | Return words via $VARNAME |
| -i VARNAME | Return cword via $VARNAME |

#### Example usage
```
_get_comp_words_by_ref -n : cur prev
```


### _get_cword()
**@deprecated** Use `_get_comp_words_by_ref cur` instead.  
Get the word to complete.  
This is nicer than `${COMP_WORDS[$COMP_CWORD]}`, since it handles cases where the user is completing in the middle of a word.  
For example, if the line is following with cursor as shown:
```
ls foobar
     ^
```

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 string | Characters out of `$COMP_WORDBREAKS` which should **NOT** be considered word breaks. <br/>This is useful for things like `scp` where we want to return `host:path` and not only `path`, so we would pass the colon (`:`) as `$1` in this case.
| $2 integer | Index number of word to return, negatively offset to the current word (default is 0, previous is 1), respecting the exclusions given at `$1`. <br>For example, `_get_cword "=:" 1` returns the word left of the current word, respecting the exclusions `=:`.


#### See
`_get_comp_words_by_ref()`


### _get_pword()
**@deprecated** Use `_get_comp_words_by_ref cur prev` instead.  
Get word previous to the current word.  
This is a good alternative to `prev=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}` because `bash4` will properly return the previous word with respect to any given exclusions to `COMP_WORDBREAKS`.  

#### See
`_get_comp_words_by_ref()`


### __ltrim_colon_completions()
**@modifies** global array `$COMPREPLY`  
If the word-to-complete contains a colon (`:`), left-trim `COMPREPLY` items with word-to-complete.  
With a colon in `COMP_WORDBREAKS`, words containing colons are always completed as entire words if the word to complete contains a colon. This function fixes this, by removing the colon-containing-prefix from `COMPREPLY` items.  
The preferred solution is to remove the colon (`:`) from `COMP_WORDBREAKS` in your `.bashrc`:
```
# Remove colon (:) from list of word completion separators
COMP_WORDBREAKS=${COMP_WORDBREAKS//:}
```

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | current word to complete (cur) |


### _quote_readline_by_ref()
This function quotes the argument in a way so that readline dequoting results in the original argument.  
This is necessary for at least `compgen` which requires its arguments quoted/escaped:
```
$ ls "a'b/"
c
$ compgen -f "a'b/"       # Wrong, doesn't return output
$ compgen -f "a\'b/"      # Good
a\'b/c
```

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | Argument to quote
| $2 | Name of variable to return result to


### _split_longopt()
This function splits `$cur=--foo=bar` into `$prev=--foo` and `$cur=bar`, making it easier to support both `--foo bar` and `--foo=bar` style completions.  
`=` should have been removed from `COMP_WORDBREAKS` when setting `$cur` for this to be useful.

#### Returns
0 if current option was split  
1 otherwise


### _init_completion()
Initialize completion and deal with various general things: do file and variable completion where appropriate, and adjust `prev`, `words`, and `cword` as if no redirections exist so that completions do not need to deal with them.  
Before calling this function, make sure `cur`, `prev`, `words`, and `cword` are `local`, ditto split if you use `-s`.

#### Options

#### Available OPTIONS
| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| -n EXCLUDE | Passed to `_get_comp_words_by_ref -n` with redirection chars |
| -e XSPEC   | Passed to `_filedir` as first arg for `stderr` redirections |
| -o XSPEC   | Passed to `_filedir` as first arg for other output redirections |
| -i XSPEC   | Passed to `_filedir` as first arg for `stdin` redirections |
| -s         | Split long options with `_split_longopt`, implies `-n =` |

#### Returns
True (0) if completion needs further processing,  
False (> 0) no further processing is necessary.


### __parse_options()
Helper function for `_parse_help` and `_parse_usage`.


### _parse_help()
Parse GNU style help output of the given command.

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | command; if `-`, read from `stdin` and ignore rest of args |

### _parse_usage()
Parse BSD style usage output (options in brackets) of the given command.

#### Parameters
| param | description |
| --- | --- |
| $1 | command; if `-`, read from `stdin` and ignore rest of args |
| $2 | command options (default: `--usage`) |


### _ncpus()
Echo number of CPUs, falling back to 1 on failure.


### __expand_tilde_by_ref()
Expand variable starting with tilde (`~`)  
We want to expand `~foo/...` to `/home/foo/...` to avoid problems when word-to-complete starting with a tilde is fed to commands and ending up quoted instead of expanded.  
Only the first portion of the variable from the tilde up to the first slash (`~../`) is expanded.  
The remainder of the variable, containing for example a dollar sign variable (`$`) or asterisk (`*`) is not expanded.  

#### Example usage
```
v="~"; __expand_tilde_by_ref v; echo "$v"  
```

#### Example output
```
       v                  output
    --------         ----------------
    ~                /home/user
    ~foo/bar         /home/foo/bar
    ~foo/$HOME       /home/foo/$HOME
    ~foo/a  b        /home/foo/a  b
    ~foo/*           /home/foo/*
```

#### Parameters

## Userland


### _uids()
This function completes on user IDs


### _gids()
This function completes on group IDs


### _usergroup()
This function completes on `user` or `user:group` format; as for `chown` and `cpio`.  
The `:` must be added manually; it will only complete usernames initially.

CD device names


### _dvd_devices()
DVD device names



## Files & Directories


### _expand()
This function expands tildes in pathnames


### _filedir()
This function performs file and directory completion.  
It's better than simply using `compgen -f`, because it honours spaces in filenames.

### _known_hosts()
**@deprecated** Using this function as a helper function is deprecated. Use `_known_hosts_real` instead.


### _known_hosts_real()
Helper function for completing _known_hosts.  
This function performs host completion based on ssh's `config` and `known_hosts` files, as well as hostnames reported by `avahi-browse` if `COMP_KNOWN_HOSTS_WITH_AVAHI` is set to a non-empty value.  
Also hosts from `HOSTFILE` (`compgen -A hostname`) are added, unless `COMP_KNOWN_HOSTS_WITH_HOSTFILE` is set to an empty value.
