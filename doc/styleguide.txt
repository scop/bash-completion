Coding Style Guide
==================

Introduction
------------
This document attempts to explain the basic styles and patterns that
are used in the bash completion.  New code should try to conform to
these standards so that it is as easy to maintain as existing code.
Of course every rule has an exception, but it's important to know
the rules nonetheless!

This is particularly directed at people new to the bash completion
codebase, who are in the process of getting their code reviewed.
Before getting a review, please read over this document and make
sure your code conforms to the recommendations here.

Indentation
-----------
Indent step should be 4 spaces, no tabs.

Globbing in case labels
-----------------------

Avoid "fancy" globbing in case labels, just use traditional style when
possible.  For example, do "--foo|--bar)" instead of "--@(foo|bar))".
Rationale: the former is easier to read, often easier to grep, and
doesn't confuse editors as bad as the latter, and is concise enough.

&#91;[ ]] vs [ ]
----------------

Always use [[ ]] instead of [ ].  Rationale: the former is less error
prone, more featureful, and slightly faster.

Line wrapping
-------------

Try to wrap lines at 79 characters. Never go past this limit, unless
you absolutely need to (example: a long sed regular expression, or the
like). This also holds true for the documentation and the testsuite.
Other files, like ChangeLog, or COPYING, are exempt from this rule.

$(...) vs \`...`
----------------

When you need to do some code substitution in your completion script,
you *MUST* use the $(...) construct, rather than the \`...`. The former
is preferable because anyone, with any keyboard layout, is able to
type it. Backticks aren't always available, without doing strange
key combinations.

-o filenames
------------

As a rule of thumb, do not use "complete -o filenames". Doing it makes
it take effect for all completions from the affected function, which
may break things if some completions from the function must not be
escaped as filenames. Instead, use "compopt -o filenames" to turn on
"-o filenames" behavior dynamically when returning completions that
need that kind of processing (e.g. file and command names). The
_filedir and _filedir_xspec helpers do this automatically whenever
they return some completions.
