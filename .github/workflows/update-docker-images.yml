name: update-docker-images

# Update Docker images when the set of commands required present for testing
# change. This is not perfect as it would be good to have the new commands
# installed already at PR time, and at least at time the change lands in the
# default branch. That way it'd be tested immediately then with images
# containing it, instead of later along with some other, completely unrelated
# change.
